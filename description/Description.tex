	\section*{Project description}
	Our project aims to implement a database for a simple customer relationship management 
	for a travel agency. 
	Several travel agencies employ collaborators. These employees sell trips to 
	customers. 
	In our example, the trips are organized trips. They also have a begin date, a 
	duration, a price and a category. 
	The category can be e.g. cruse, road trip, safari, ...
